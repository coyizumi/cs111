To build, run make or make all.

To run, run the generated executable named "cat"

Usage: cat [FILE]...

Notes:
In the Makefile, the standard is explicitly set to gnu11. This is redundant (clang already defaults to gnu11 as the standard), but it makes it a bit easier to quickly test changes on the linux box where I'm writing the code.
