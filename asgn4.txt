NOTES:

protectfile and cryptofs currently behave slightly differently when encrypting,
and are not currently compatible. They each work individually.

Protectfile can be tested by running it on the same file twice.

cryptofs can be tested with the following example commands:

setkey <16 digit hex key>
mount_cryptofs src target
touch target/testfile
chmod +t target/testfile
echo "Hello" > target/testfile
cat target/testfile
  ** Should be "Hello"
cat src/testfile
  ** Garbage **

To build mount_cryptofs, navigate to sbin/mount_cryptofs and run make
